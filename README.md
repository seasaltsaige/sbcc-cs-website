# SBCC CS Club Website
This repository houses the code base that the Santa Barbara City College Computer Science Club is running off of.
This website was developed by the people, for the people, and will be passed on as officers change, allowing for the site to continue to be updated and improved as time goes on.
This aims to provide some main functions for the club that will hopefully streamline a lot of processes. From creating events and RSVPing, to Creating and Voting on Elections for Officer positions.


### Work in progress
If you wish to help me with this project, and you are part of the club, contact me and I'll see how you can help.
I'm using the **MERN stack**, so if you're familiar, that would be ideal.


### Planned Features
- / -> Will house the intro to the club, landing page. Could contain a short statement, and maybe a sliding panel of say, the next event, and a link to an election if its happening soon. Who knows, we'll see.

- /about -> Will house the club statement, and what you can expect from joining the club, and participating in events that are put on.

- /officers/past -> Will need to contact officers about this, but if officers wish to remain on the website, after their time is up, this is where they can be kept.
- /officers/present -> Again, will want to talk about pictures and if they even want to be on here, but if so, can list the current club officers and contact info potentially.

- /events/past -> Could house past events (potentially posting ones that have already past), and will automatically archive events that have past. Potentially allowing officers to attach photos of the event to the given spot on the website, AGAIN, as long as people are ok with being hosted online like that.
- /events/upcoming -> Houses all the upcoming events that the club wants to do, descriptions, RSVPing, etc.

- /elections -> If an election is running/going to run, can house the potential officers that are running, allowing people to see who they might want to vote for.
- /elections/vote -> Allows a person to vote for candidates that they want elected. Will probably want some kind of auth to prevent random people from voting. Generated codes is an idea, but I need to think about it more.


- /admin/login -> Officer only page, that allows initial creation of an admin account, loging in, and updating the account info. Logging in as an officer will allow you to **post**, **delete**, and **update events**; **post**, **delete**, and **update officers**; **post**, **delete**, and **update election polls**; **post**, **delete**, and **update election candidates**; and potentially more as ideas are brought up. ***THIS IS A POWERFUL ACCOUNT >> ONLY GIVE PASSWORDS/USERNAMES TO OFFICERS YOU TRUST!!!!***


### Additional Plans
I also plan to integrate the website with both discord and the mailing list that the CS LTA's have access to, allowing a post to be made one time, while being sent to all locations. Discord interactions are more or less done, but will need to test once the website is fleshed out more.


***If you have any ideas that could be useful for this, contact me! I'd love to hear them!***
